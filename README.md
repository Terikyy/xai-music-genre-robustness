# CNN Robustness for Music Genre Classification with Grad-CAM

## Project Information

**Course:** Explainable AI  
**University:** DHBW Stuttgart  

## Research Question

How robust is a CNN for music genre classification against noise perturbations, and how can Grad-CAM be used to visualize which regions of the spectrogram the model uses for its decisions and how these change due to adversarial perturbations?
